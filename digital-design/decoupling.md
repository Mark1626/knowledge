# Decoupling

[Back](../index.md#digital-design){: .button}

Decoupling is the prevention of undesired electrical energy transfer (coupling) between subsystems.

Example is connecting localized decoupling capacitors close to the power leads of integrated circuits to suppress coupling via the power supply connections. These act as a small localized energy reservoir that supply the circuit with current during transient, high current demand periods, preventing the voltage on the power supply rail from being pulled down by the momentary current load
