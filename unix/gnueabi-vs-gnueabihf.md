The `eabi` stands for the compilation of code which will run on bare metal arm core.

> gcc-arm-linux-gnueabi is the cross-toolchain package for the armel architecture. This toolchain implies the EABI generated by gcc's -mfloat-abi=soft or -mfloat-abi=softfp options.

> gcc-arm-linux-gnueabihf is the cross-toolchain package for the armhf architecture. This toolchain implies the EABI generated by the gcc -mfloat-abi=hard option.
