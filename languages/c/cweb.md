# CWeb

[Back](./c.md)

C Web is a literate programming version of C from Donald E. Knuth and Silvio Levy.

Files have a `.w` extension

**CTANGLE:** converts a source file foo.w to a compilable program file foo.c;
**CWEAVE:** converts a source file foo.w to a prettily-printable and cross-indexed document file foo.tex.
