# Curry-Howard isomorphism

[Back](../../index.md#category-theory)

Every type can be interpreted as a proposition - a 
statement or a judgment that may be true or false.
Such a proposition is considered true if the type is 
inhabited and false if it isn't. In particular, a 
logical implication is true if the function 
type corresponding to it is inhabited, or a function 
exists of that type. An example of a function is a 
proof of a theorem.
